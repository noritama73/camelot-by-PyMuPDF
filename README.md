# What is this?

This module is a modification of [camelot][1].

[1]:https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot

## CHANGED POINT

Original version of camelot used "PyPDF2" package, however the package have not been maintained for a long time.
So camelot has several problems like

- can't read files with th exception of ones encoded by utf-8
- some files are unexpectedly encrypted

When using "PyMuPDF", most of the problems are resolved.

## OTHERS

This repository is for my personal use.
